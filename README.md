# DD2424 Final Project - Attention Augmented Convolutional Networks 
Final project of KTH course DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science.
This project consists of a simplified replication of the paper [*Attention Augmented Convolutional Networks*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09925.pdf). The main goal was augmenting Convolutional Networks by using self-attention. As a result, we have convolutions that also detect long range interactions. 

To run the experiments:
- Go to [scripts](/scripts).
- Select the architecture of the network.
- Modify the network parameters to customize the architecture.
- Run the selected code (it needs TensorFlow in its version 2 to run).

The conclsusions of the different experiments can be found in [Group76 Project Report](Group76_Project_Report.pdf).
