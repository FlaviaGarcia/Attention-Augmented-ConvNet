# DD2424 Final Project
Final project of KTH course DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science.
This project consists of a simplified replication of the paper [*Attention Augmented Convolutional Networks*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09925.pdf).

To run the experiments:
- Go to [scripts](/scripts).
- Select the architecture of the network.
- Modify the network parameters to customize the architecture.
- Run the selected code (it needs TensorFlow in its version 2 to run).

The conclsusions of the different experiments can be find in Group76_Project_Report.pdf
